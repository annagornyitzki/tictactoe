## How to Play

1. Click any empty tile to place your X.
2. The AI (O) will make its move automatically.
3. The game ends when someone wins or the board is full (tie).
4. Click the **Restart** button to start a new game at any time.
   
## Customization

- **AI Difficulty:** The AI currently picks random empty tiles. You can improve it by adding smarter logic in `aiMove()` in [`tictactoe.js`](tictactoe.js).
- **Styling:** Modify [`tictactoe.css`](tictactoe.css) to change colors, fonts, or layout.
- **Background:** Replace `tictactoe-background.jpg` with your own image for a custom background.
